To start:
Copy configuration.scad.dist to configuration.scad and fill custom
settings section there


RP every .scad in this directory (except complete-printer) once.
Aim for 0.3mm layers and 2.2 extrusion width (width over thickness),
for 0.66mm stroke width. Printer is tested at this setting.

Using doc/complete-printer.scad as a visual clue and doc/manual.txt as a
guide, build the printer.
